This chapter describes the Expression Logical Model (ELM) and how it is used to represent clinical knowledge within a quality artifact.

The ELM defines a mechanism for representing artifact logic independent of syntax and special-purpose constructs introduced at the syntactic level. ELM is equivalent to CQL syntax in terms of expressive power: every possible expression in CQL has an equivalent canonical-form expression in ELM. Higher-level constructs such as timing phrases and implicit conversions are represented in terms of the more primitive operators in ELM. This takes the burden of interpretation of higher-level constructs off of implementers, allowing them to focus on the implementation of a more primitive set of functionality.

Expressions within ELM are represented as Abstract Syntax Trees. ELM defines the base _Expression_ class, and all language elements and operators are then defined as descendants of the base _Expression_. For example, the _Add_ class descends from _BinaryExpression_, which introduces two operands, each of type _Expression_. The _Literal_ class descends from _Expression_ and allows primitive-typed values such as strings and integers to be represented directly. Using these classes, the expression 2 [.sym]#+# 2 can be represented as instances of the appropriate classes:

[[figure-4-a]]

Figure 4‑A

By combining instances of the appropriate classes of ELM, the logic for any expression can be represented. Note that the type of the expression can be inferred from the representation, Integer in this example.

The ELM consists of the following components:

* Expression – This component defines the core structures for representing expressions, as well as the operations available within those expressions.
* Clinical Expression – This component extends the Expression component to introduce expressions specific to the clinical quality domain.
* Library – This component defines the structure of a library, the container, and the basic unit of sharing.

Each of these components is defined fully within the ELM UML model. This model is defined formally as an XMI, and the model definition is also presented as an Enterprise Architect Project file (.eap) for viewing.

The documentation provided here serves only as a high-level structural reference for the ELM. The actual content of the specification is defined by the XMI file, and that provides the “source-of-truth” for the ELM specification.

Note that the semantics for the operations described here are defined both in the UML model as comments on the node for each operator, as well as the equivalent CQL operation as defined in <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#appendix-b-cql-reference,Appendix B – CQL Reference>>.

[[expressions]]
== Expressions

The ELM Expression component defines a mechanism for representing the structure of logic. The following table lists the core elements defined by the ELM:

[[table-4-a]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|=====================================================================
^|*Expression* ^|*Description*
|*Expression*{set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA} |Abstract base class for all expressions in ELM
|*UnaryExpression*{set:cellbgcolor:white} |Abstract base class for unary expressions in ELM
|*BinaryExpression*{set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA} |Abstract base class for binary expressions in ELM
|*TernaryExpression*{set:cellbgcolor:white} |Abstract base class for ternary expressions in ELM
|*NaryExpression*{set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA} |Abstract base class for n-ary expressions in ELM
|=====================================================================

Table 4‑A

Every expression in ELM is represented as a descendant of the abstract base element _Expression_. In addition, several abstract descendants are introduced to support the representation of unary, binary, ternary, and n-ary operators. Note that an expression need not descend from one of these descendants, it may descend from _Expression_ directly.

[[simple-values-1]]
== Simple Values

Support for simple values is provided by the _Literal_ class. This class defines properties to represent the type of the value, as well as the value itself.

The following table lists the simple value classes available in ELM:

[[table-4-b]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|=========================================
^|*Expression* ^|*Description*
|*Literal* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Represents simple value literals
|=========================================

Table 4‑B

The _Literal_ class is used to represent values for simple primitive types: Boolean, String, Integer, Decimal, Date, DateTime, and Time.

The result type of a _Literal_ is the type of the primitive being represented.

For more information on the primitive types, see the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#types,Types>> section in the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#appendix-b-cql-reference,CQL Reference>>.

[[comparison-operators-1]]
== Comparison Operators

ELM defines a standard set of comparison operators for use with simple values. Each comparison operator takes two arguments of the same type, and returns a boolean indicating the result of the comparison. Note that for comparison operators, if either or both operands evaluate to null, the result of the comparison is _null_, not false.

The following table lists the comparison operators available in ELM:

[[table-4-c]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|================================================================================================
^|*Expression* ^|*Description*
|*Equal* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Returns true if the operands are equal
|*Equivalent*{set:cellbgcolor:white} |Returns true if the operands are equivalent
|*NotEqual*{set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA} |Returns true if the operands are not equal
|*Less*{set:cellbgcolor:white} |Returns true if the first operand is less than the second operand
|*LessOrEqual* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Returns true if the first operand is less than or equal to the second operand
|*Greater*{set:cellbgcolor:white} |Returns true if the first operand is greater than the second operand
|*GreaterOrEqual* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Returns true if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand
|================================================================================================

Table 4‑C

The following example illustrates a simple _Equal_ comparison:

For more information on the semantics of the various comparison operators, see the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#comparison-operators,Comparison Operators>> section of the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#appendix-b-cql-reference,CQL Reference>>.

[[logical-operators-1]]
== Logical Operators

ELM defines logical operators that can be used to combine the results of logical expressions. _And_ and _Or_ can be used to combine any number of results, and _Not_ can be used to invert the result of any expression.

Note that these operators are defined with 3-valued logic semantics, allowing the operators to deal consistently with missing information.

The following table lists the logical operators available in ELM:

[[table-4-d]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|========================================================
^|*Expression* ^|*Description*
|*And* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Returns the logical conjunction of its operands
|*Or*{set:cellbgcolor:white} |Returns the logical disjunction of its operands
|*Not* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Returns the logical negation of its operand
|*Implies* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|Returns the logical implication of its operands
|*Xor*{set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA} |Returns the exclusive or of its operands
|========================================================

Table 4‑D

The following example illustrates a simple _And_ expression:

[[nullological-operators-1]]
== Nullological Operators

ELM defines several nullological operators that are useful for dealing with potentially missing information. These are _Null, IsNull_, _IsTrue_, _IsFalse_, and _Coalesce_.

The following table lists the logical operators available in ELM:

[[table-4-e]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|======================================================================================
^|*Expression* ^|*Description*
|*Null* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Returns a typed null
|*IsNull* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|Returns true if the argument is _null_, false otherwise
|*IsTrue* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Returns true if the argument is _true_, false otherwise

|*Coalesce* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Returns the first non-null argument, null if there are no non-null arguments
|======================================================================================

Table 4‑E

For more information on the semantics of these operators, refer to the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#nullological-operators,Nullological Operators>> section in the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#appendix-b-cql-reference,CQL Reference>>.

[[conditional-operators]]
== Conditional Operators

ELM defines several conditional expressions that can be used to return different values based on a condition, or set of conditions. These are the _If_ (conditional) expression, and the _Case_ expression.

The conditional expression allows a simple condition to be used to decide between one expression or another.

The case expression has two varieties, one that is equivalent to repeated conditionals, and one that allows a specific comparand to be identified and compared with each item to determine a result.

The following table lists the conditional operators available in ELM:

[[table-4-f]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|======================================================================================
^|*Expression* ^|*Description*
|*If*{set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA} |Allows for conditional evaluation between two expressions.
|*Case* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|Allows for multiple conditional expressions, or a comparand with multiple cases.
|======================================================================================

Table 4‑F

The following examples illustrates a simple _If_ expression (i.e. if / then / else):

[[arithmetic-operators-1]]
== Arithmetic Operators

ELM provides a complete set of arithmetic operators to allow for manipulation of integer and real values within artifacts. In general, these operators have the expected semantics for arithmetic operators.

Note that if an operand evaluates to null, the result of the operation is defined to be null. This provides consistent semantics when dealing with missing information.

The following table lists the arithmetic operators available in ELM:

[[string-operators-1]]
== String Operators

ELM defines a set of string operators to allow for manipulation of string values within artifact definitions.

Indexes within strings are defined to be 0-based.

Note that except as noted within the documentation for each operator, if any argument evaluates to null, the result of the operation is also defined to be null.

The following table lists the string operators available in ELM:

[[table-4-h]]

[[date-and-time-operators]]
== Date and Time Operators

ELM defines several operators for representating the manipulation of date and time values. These operators are defined using a common precision type that allows the various precisions (e.g. day, month, week, hour, minute, second) of time to be manipulated.

Except as noted within the documentation for each operator, if any argument evaluates to null, the result of the operation is also defined to be null.

The following table lists the date and time operators available in ELM:

[[table-4-i]]

[[interval-operators]]
== Interval Operators

ELM defines a complete set of operators for use in defining and manipulating interval values.

Constructing an interval is performed with the _Interval_ expression, which allows the beginning and ending of the interval to be specified, as well as whether the interval beginning and ending is exclusive (open), or inclusive (closed).

ELM defines support for basic operations on intervals including determining length, accessing interval properties, and determining interval boundaries.

ELM also supports complete operations involving comparisons of intervals, including equality, membership testing, and inclusion testing.

In addition, the language supports operators for combining and manipulating intervals.

The following table provides a complete listing of the interval operators available in ELM:

[[table-4-j]]

For more information on the semantics of these operators, refer to the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#interval-operators,Interval Operators>> section in the <<09-b-cqlreference.adoc#appendix-b-cql-reference,CQL Reference>>.

[[structured-values]]
== Structured Values

Structured values in ELM are values with sets of named elements (tuples), each of which may have a value of any type. Structured values are most commonly used to represent clinical information such as encounters, problems, and procedures.

The _Tuple_ class represents construction of a new structured value, with the values for each element supplied by _TupleElement_ instances.

To access elements of a structured value, use the _Property_ expression. A property expression has a _path_ attribute, an optional _source_ element, and a _value_ element. The source element returns the structured value to be accessed. In some contexts, such as within a _Filter_ expression, the source is implicit. If used outside such a context, a source must be provided.

The path attribute specifies a property path relative to the source structured value. The property expression returns the value of the property specified by the property path. Property paths are allowed to include qualifiers ([.sym]#.#) as well as indexers ([.sym]#[x]#) to indicate that subelements should be traversed. Indexers specified in paths must be literal integer values.

The following table lists the structured value operators available in ELM:

[[table-4-k]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|===============================================================
^|*Expression* ^|*Description*
|*Tuple*{set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA} |Constructs a new tuple value

Figure 4‑I

[[list-values-1]]
== List Values

ELM allows for the expression and manipulation of lists of values of any type. The most basic list operation is the _List_ class, which represents a simple list selector.

Basic list operations include testing for membership, indexing, and content. ELM also supports comparison of lists, including equality and inclusion determination (subset/superset). Supported operations on single lists include filtering, sorting, and computation. For multiple lists, ELM supports combining through union and intersection, as well as computing the difference.

The use of the scope attribute allows for more complex expressions such as correlated subqueries.

ELM also supports a flattening operator, _Flatten_ to construct a single list from a list of lists.

The following table provides a complete listing of the list operators available in ELM:

[[table-4-l]]

[[aggregate-operators-1]]
== Aggregate Operators

For computing aggregate quantities, ELM defines several aggregate operators. These operators perform computations on lists of values, either on the elements of the list directly, or on a specific property of each element in the list.

Unless noted in the documentation for each operator, aggregate operators deal with missing information by excluding elements which have no value before performing the aggregation. In addition, an aggregate operation performed over an empty list is defined to return null, except as noted in the documentation for each operator (e.g. Count).

The following table lists the aggregate operators available in ELM:

[[queries-2]]
== Queries

ELM provides a mechanism for expressing the structure of a query using the following classes:

[[table-4-o]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
^|*Class* ^|*Description*
|*Query* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Defines a query in ELM, containing clauses as defined by the other elements in this section.
|*AliasedQuerySource* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|The AliasedQuerySource element defines a single source for inclusion in the query context. The type of the source is determined by the expression element, and the source can be accessed within the query context by the given alias.
|*LetClause*{set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA} |The LetClause element allows any number of expression definitions to be introduced within a query context. Defined expressions can be referenced by name within the query context.
|*With*{set:cellbgcolor:white} |The With clause restricts the elements of a given source to only those elements that have elements in the related source that satisfy the suchThat condition. This operation is known as a semi-join in database languages.
|*Without* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|The Without clause restricts the elements of a given source to only those elements that do not have elements in the related source that satisfy the suchThat condition. This operation is known as a semi-difference in database languages.
|*SortClause*{set:cellbgcolor:white} |The SortClause element defines the sort order for the query, and is made up of any number of elements that are descendants of the SortByItem class (ByDirection, ByColumn, or ByExpression).
|*ByDirection* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Indicates that the sort should be performed ascending or descending. This sortByItem can only appear by itself in a sort clause, and is used when the query is based on a list of non-tuple-valued elements.
|*ByColumn* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|Indicates that the sort should be performed based on the values of a specified column.
|*ByExpression* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Indicates that the sort should be performed based on the result of an expression.
|*ReturnClause* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|The ReturnClause element defines the shape of the result set of the query.

[[reusing-logic]]
== Reusing Logic

ELM provides a mechanism for reusing expressions by declaring a named expression. This construct is similar to a function call with no parameters in a traditional imperative language, with the exception that since ELM is a pure-functional system, the result of the evaluation could be cached by an implementation to avoid performing the same computation multiple times.

In addition, ELM provides a more traditional function call with named parameters that can then be accessed by the expression in the function body, and passed as part of the call from the invoking context.

The _ExpressionDef_ class is used to define a named expression that can then be referenced by other expressions. The _FunctionDef_ class is used to define a function and its parameters.

Note that circular expression references are not allowed, but that named expressions can be defined in any order, so long as the actual references do not result in a cycle.

The following table lists the expression definition components available in ELM:

[[table-4-p]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|===================================================================================================================
^|*Expression* ^|*Description*
|*ExpressionDef*{set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA} |Defines a named expression that can be referenced by other expressions
|*ExpressionRef* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|Returns the result of evaluating a named expression
|*FunctionDef* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Defines a function that can be referenced by other expressions, or within the body of other functions.
|*FunctionRef* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|Returns the result of evaluating a function with the given arguments
|===================================================================================================================

Table 4‑P

The _ExpressionDef_ class introduces the notion of _context_ which can be either Patient or Population. This context defines how the contained expression is evaluated, either with respect to a single patient, defined by the evaluation environment, or with respect to a population. For more information about patient context, please refer to the <<External Data>> section.

[[external-data]]
== External Data

All access to external data within ELM is represented by _Retrieve_ expressions.

The _Retrieve_ class defines the data type of the request, which determines the type of elements to be returned. The result will always be a list of values of the type specified in the request.

The type of the elements to be returned is specified with the _dataType_ attribute of the _Retrieve_, and must refer to the name of a type within a known data model specified in the _dataModels_ element of the library definition.

In addition, the _Retrieve_ introduces the ability to specify optional criteria for the request. The available criteria are intentionally restricted to the set of codes involved, and the date range involved. If these criteria are omitted, the request is interpreted to mean all data of that type.

Note that because every expression is being evaluated within a context (either Patient or Population) as defined by the containing _ExpressionDef_, the data returned by a retrieve depends on the context. For the Patient context, the data is returned for a single patient only, as defined by the evaluation environment. Whereas for the Population context, the data is returned for all patients.

The following table lists the expressions relevant to defining external data in ELM:

[[table-4-q]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|=====================================================================
^|*Expression* ^|*Description*
|*Retrieve* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Defines clinical data that will be used within the artifact
|=====================================================================

[[clinical-operators-1]]
== Clinical Operators

For working with clinical data, ELM defines operators for terminology sets, quantities, and calculating age.

The following table lists the classes representing clinical information in ELM:

|*CalculateAgeAt* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Calculates the age in the specified precision of a person born on the first date as of the second date.
|=======================================================================================================================

Table 4‑R

[[parameters-1]]
== Parameters

In addition to external data, ELM provides a mechanism for defining parameters to an artifact. A library can define any number of parameters, each of which has a name, and a defined type, as well as an optional default value.

Parameter values, if any, are expected to be provided as part of the evaluation request, and can be accessed with a _ParameterRef_ expression in any expression throughout the library.

The following table lists the expressions relevant to parameters in ELM:

[[table-4-s]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|=================================================
^|*Expression* ^|*Description*
|*ParameterDef* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Defines a parameter to the artifact
|*ParameterRef* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|Returns the value of a parameter
|=================================================

Table 4‑S

[[data-model]]
== Data Model

ELM does not reference any specific data model, and so can be used to represent logic expressed against any data model. These data models are specified using the _UsingDef_ class. This class provides attributes for specifying the name and version of the data model. An ELM library can reference any number of models.

The name of the model is an implementation-specific identifier that provides the environment with a mechanism for finding the model description. The details of how that model description is provided are part of the physical representation.

The following table lists the elements relevant to data models in ELM:

[[table-4-t]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|=================================================================================
^|*Element* ^|*Description*
|*UsingDef* {set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA}|Defines a data model that can be used by expressions within the library
|=================================================================================

Table 4‑T

[[libraries-2]]
== Libraries

ELM defines the notion of a library as the basic container for logic constructs. Libraries consist of sets of declarations including data model references, library references, valueset definitions, parameters, functions, and named expressions. The _Library_ class defines this unit and defines properties for each of these types of declarations.

Once defined, libraries can then be referenced by other libraries with the _IncludeDef_ class, which defines properties for the name and version of the library being referenced, as well as a local name that is used to access components of the library.

The following table lists the elements relevant to libraries in ELM:

[[table-4-u]]
[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|==============================================================================================================================================
^|*Element* ^|*Description*
|*IncludeDef*{set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA} |Defines a library reference; public components of the included library can be referenced by components of the referencing library.
|*VersionedIdentifier* {set:cellbgcolor:white}|Defines the versioned identifier construct used to label the various declarations throughout ELM
|==============================================================================================================================================

Table 4‑U

[[errors-and-messages]]
== Errors and Messages

ELM defines a utility operation that is useful for generating run-time messages, warnings, traces, and errors. The operator is a single, general-purpose function intended to provide a single implementation point for messaging and run-time error functionality when those messages are generated from ELM logic.

[cols=",",options="header",]
{set:cellbgcolor:#D9E6FC}
|=============================================================================================================================
^|*Element* ^|*Description*
|*Message*{set:cellbgcolor:#F0F5FA} |Provides a mechanism for generating and returning messages, warnings, errors, and traces to the calling environment.
|=============================================================================================================================

The source parameter is always a generic value, which is always the result of the operator and is purely passthrough. This allows the operation to appear at any point in any expression of ELM.

The optional condition parameter determines whether or not the message is generated. If no condition is supplied, the default is true and the message is generated.

There is an optional code parameter which allows a coded representation of the message. (Note this is an error token such as an integer or string, not a clinical terminology Code).

There is an optional severity parameter which allows the severity of the message to be specified, one of:

* Message – The operation produces an informational message that is expected to be made available in some way to the calling environment.
* Warning – The operation produces a warning message that is expected to be made conspicuously available to the calling environment, potentially to the end-user of the logic.
* Trace – The operation produces an informational message that is expected to be made available to a tracing mechanism such as a debug log in the calling environment.
* Error – The operation produces a run-time error and return the message to the calling environment. This is the only severity that stops evaluation. All other severities continue evaluation of the expression.

If no severity is supplied, a default severity of Message is assumed.
